- Use the shortcut key ``F8`` to resume, you can see the program stops at the ``void bfl_main()`` main function, you can click the three buttons in the figure below. Their meanings are

   - First Step Into (F5) Single-step execution, entering and continuing single-step execution when sub-functions are encountered.

   - The second Step Over (F6) does not go into subfunctions when encountered within a function during single-step execution, but instead stops the entire execution of the subfunctions as a single step.

   - The third Step Return (F7) is used to finish the remainder of the sub-function and return the previous level function when a single step is executed into the sub-function.
