This example explains how to use Bluetooth Low-Energy.

Usage Steps
-----------

- Compile and flash ``customer_app/bl602_demo_event`` or ``customer_app/bl702_demo_event`` .
- Use ``stack_ble`` command to inialize the BLE stack. Example logs:

- SMP pairing. Commands vary depending on the BLE security level 2 vs 3.
 
 - ``ble_security 2``

	.. figure:: imgs/image8.png
	   :alt:
	   
   - Displays ``Confirm passkey for xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx (public)`` . Use the command ``ble_auth_pairing_confirm`` to confirm pairing.
	
	 .. figure:: imgs/image23.png
